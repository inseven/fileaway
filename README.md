## Overview

Right now the macOS and iOS apps are incredibly divergent having been written with significantly different ideas of what makes for a good file management app: the iOS came first and focuses solely on the process of rule based filing, while the latest iteration of the macOS app (there have been many) also introduces a Mail-like file browser.

## Development

Fileaway follows the version numbering, build and signing conventions for Jason Morley apps. Further details can be found [here](https://github.com/inseven/build-documentation).
