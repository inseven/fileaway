Fileaway does not collect or store any personal data.

By default, your files and rules remain local to your device. If you add locations provided by third-parties (such as iCloud Drive or Dropbox), files and settings within those locations may be shared with the respective third-parties, and governed by their data protection and privacy polices.

Should this policy change in the future, we will make all reasonable efforts to inform you and provide mechanisms to opt-out.
